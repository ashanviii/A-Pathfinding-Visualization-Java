# A-Pathfinding-Visualization-Java

## Basic Controls
You must create a map to start the pathfinding. The start node is blue, end node is red and the walls are black. 

To create nodes:
  - Start: hold 's' + left click
  - End: hold 'e' + left click
  - Wall: left click
  
To delete nodes:
  - same as creation, except right click!

### Diagonal
My algorithm supports both diagonal and non diagonal pathfinding. 

Simply check the "diagonal" box at the bottom left of the screen.

### Variable Speed
You may change the speed of the visualization during runtime. 
  - By default, speed is 50%. 

Notice: speed only works when showSteps is true. 

if showSteps is false, well, that leads into the next section.. 

### Show Steps or Timed Efficiency
You may choose to view a step-by-step process of the algorithm by selecting "showSteps" box at the bottom left. 
  - If showSteps is false, the algorithm will skip visuals until the end, and process as fast as possible.
